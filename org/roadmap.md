Our goal is to not make radical changes to process or approach, but iterate on our working methods to increase velocity and output in a stable, consistent way.

## Prepare to Gate cncf/k8s-conformance PRs

-   [cncf/apisnoop/projects/ cncf/k8s-conformance gate](https://github.com/cncf/apisnoop/projects/29)

### KR1 Setup prow.cncf.io

This repo is outside kubernetes org.

We'll need to set this up in a sustainable/supportable way.

-   [X] DNS prow.cncf.io pointing to prow.apisnoop.io
-   [ ] Grant cncf-ci bot permissions to cncf github org
-   [ ] Researching the isolation / clusters used by test-infra / k8s-infra-wg
-   [ ] Deploy clusters for prow.cncf.io
-   [ ] Deploy prow onto said clusters
-   [ ] Look into setting up #wg-cncf-infra if there is interest

### KR2 Connect cncf/k8s-conformance to prow.cncf.io

Comments and admin actions from prow.cncf.io

Will be made using the [cncf-ci](https://github.com/cncf-ci) bot/github account.

-   [ ] Enable meow and simple prow bot plugins

### KR3 gate+comment w/ list of unrun conformance tests

-   [ ] generate list of test run in a PR
-   [ ] generate list of tests required for PR version
-   [ ] comment with list of missing tests if under 20
-   [ ] comment with count of missing test if over 20
-   [ ] add hold tag if test lists don't match

-   definition

    Defined by the [user stories for KEP-960](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/2c19ec7627e326d1c75306dcaa3d2f14002301fa/keps/sig-architecture/960-conformance-behaviors/README.md#role-cncf-conformance-program)
    
        Must confirm that the version of the tests being run matches...
        Must confirm the set of tests being run matches...
        Must confirm that all behaviors are covered by a test...

## Prepare to Gate k/k PRs touching test/e2e or API

-   [k/k API+Conformance Gate](https://github.com/cncf/apisnoop/projects/30)

Influenced by [Behavior KEP user stories](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1666/files?short_path=92a9412#diff-92a9412ae55358378bc66295cdbea103)

while continuing to focus on endpoints.

Will show increase in endpoints, and tested endpoints, but also, explicitly, whether conformance coverage increased. Be able to say "you are adding a new endpoint to stable, and you are adding a conformance test for it"

We will investigate the method for ok'ing a pr, and who has the go-ahead to do this. Bot would likely manage the approval, but done through labels applied by people in owners file or some other set convention.

### KR1 Identify a PR as requiring conformance review

PR must touch file in conformance-specific directory

-   (initially /area-conformance + /sig-arch)
-   [ ] Create `run_if_changed` presubmit

    eg: update test/conformance/behaviors/..
    eg: mv from test/e2e to test/conformance

### KR2 Identify list of endpoints added/removed

Tooling will compare `path/operation_id` in `api/openapi-spec/swagger.json`

-   [ ] Generate list of new endpoints
-   [ ] Generate list of removed endpoints

### KR3 Run APISnoop against PR to generate endpoint coverage

Tooling will provide a list of tested and conformant endpoints.

-   [ ] Wait for main prow job to finish
-   [ ] Generate list of hit/tested endpoints
-   [ ] Generate list of conformant endpoints

### KR4 bot comment w/ list of increase/decrease of endpoints

Tooling will comment directly on PR

-   [ ] alpha : comment endpoints needing tests
-   [ ] beta : comment endpoints needing tests
-   [ ] stable : comment and block via tag

### KR5 Manual Approval for SIG-Arch (or appropriate owners)

Ensure the API Review process has been followed.

-   [ ] Get feedback on approval process from SIG-Arch
-   [ ] Ensure the correct tagging / OWNERS are respected

### KR6 Donate APISnoop to sig-arch

-   [ ] Get feedback if this is desired
-   [ ] Get as to location of repo under k8s org
-   [ ] Migration maybe in Q3

## Increase Stable Test Coverage Velocity 50% over Q1

-   [cncf/apisnoop/projects/ Conformance Test Writing](https://github.com/cncf/apisnoop/projects/28).

### KR1 (0/+40) new conformant stable endpoints

### KR2 +9% Coverage Increase

### KR3 (stretch) 50% stable endpoints hit by conformance tests

# 2020 Q1 (Jan-Mar)

## Increase Stable Test Coverage Velocity 100% over 2019 (Score:0.4)

We have the remaining 16 endpoints already soaking in the two weeks no flakes window.

We are confident they will merge shortly.

### KR1=0.4 (11/+27) new conformant stable endpoints

-   SCORE CALCULATION: 0.4 -> 1.0

    Done(11)
    
    -   Needs Two Weeks(16) = 27 -> 1.0

### kr2=0.4 +6% coverage increase

-   SCORE CALCULATION: 0.4 -> 1.0

    This number should increase to the full 6% in ~2 weeks.

## complete cncf/apisnoop prow.k8s.io + Amazon migration (Score:0.5)

### KR1=0.5 All cncf/apisnoop artifacts created by prow.k8s.io

Definitions in prow, but need to do our Q1 release&#x2026; this week.
